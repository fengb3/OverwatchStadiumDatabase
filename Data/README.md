# Data Directory

This directory contains the data generated by the Overwatch Stadium Database Worker.

## Files

### `overwatch_stadium.db`
- **Format**: SQLite Database
- **Description**: The primary database file used by the application. It contains all the crawled data including Heroes, Items, Buffs, and their relationships.
- **Usage**: Can be opened with any SQLite viewer (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite) or used directly by applications supporting SQLite.

### `full_data_dump.sql`
- **Format**: SQL Script
- **Description**: A complete data dump of the database in SQL format.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to be compatible with:
  - SQLite
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL (requires `ANSI_QUOTES` mode)
  - Microsoft SQL Server (includes `IDENTITY_INSERT` handling)
- **Usage**: Use this script to import the data into other database systems or for backup purposes.

## Generation Process
These files are automatically updated by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/update-db.yml`. The worker application crawls the target websites, updates the SQLite database, and then generates the SQL dump script.
